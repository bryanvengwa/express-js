Overview
This repository provides a boilerplate setup for creating a RESTful API using Express.js, along with implementation examples for middleware, validation, authentication, and testing.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-api-boilerplate.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd express-api-boilerplate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Starting the Server
To start the Express server, run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can customize the port by setting the PORT environment variable.

Middleware
Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. This repository includes example middleware for logging requests. You can add additional middleware functions as needed in the middleware/ directory.

Validation
Request validation is crucial for ensuring the integrity of your API. This repository includes example validation using the express-validator middleware. See routes/users.js for an example of request validation.

Authentication
Implementing authentication is essential for securing your API endpoints. This repository includes example authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). See routes/auth.js for an example of authentication middleware.

Testing
Unit and integration tests are vital for ensuring the reliability of your API. This repository includes example tests using Jest and Supertest. You can find test files in the tests/ directory. Run tests using:

bash
Copy code
npm test
